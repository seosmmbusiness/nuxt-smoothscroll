# nuxt-smoothscroll

Add app folder to Nuxt derictory to get smoothscroll
Nothing to look at ;)

Basic smoothscroll that DOESN'T work on first page load!

To use scroll on first page load use scripts in `mounted()` getting the route hash from params.
Can be used on layouts as well.
Currently I use https://github.com/rigor789/vue-scrollto
